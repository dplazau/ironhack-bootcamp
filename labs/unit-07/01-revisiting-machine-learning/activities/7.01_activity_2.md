# 7.01 Activity 2

In this exercise, you will use `files_for_activities/learningSet.csv` file.

Take a look at all the items in `drop_columns_list` (done on the class). These are the columns that we want to drop from the dataframe. Now before removing all these columns, you discussed with your manager if there is any column that would still be important to keep in the analysis. Based on their subject matter expertise, you were told that the following columns are important: `wealth1` and `wealth2`. We will remove these variables from the above list: `RDATE3`, `RAMNT_3`. These are important but they have too many null values.
