# 7.01 Activity 1

We understand the difference between regression problems and classification problems. Linear regression is one of the many machine learning regression algorithms that can be employed to solve regression problems while logistic regression is one of the many machine learning classification algorithms that can be employed to solve classification problems.

- List down two examples/case scenarios each for cases where you can use regression algorithm and where you can use classification algorithm. Describe the target variable and the kind of information available/features in the dataset, that would be used to make the prediction.
- Do your research to find such examples or develop logical examples on your own.
