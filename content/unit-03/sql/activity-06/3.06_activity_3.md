# 3.06 Activity 3

The table `client` has a field `birth_number` that encapsulates client birthday and sex. The number is in the form `YYMMDD` for men, and in the form `YYMM+50DD` for women, where `YYMMDD` is the date of birth. Create a view `client_demographics` with `client_id`, `birth_date` and `sex` fields. Use that view and a CTE to find the number of loans by status and sex.
