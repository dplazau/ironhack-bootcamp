# 3.02 Activity 1

Keep working on the `bank` database.

Use the below query and list `district_name`, `client_id` and `account_id` for those clients who are owner of the account. Order the results by `district_name`:

```sql
select * from bank.disp d
join bank.client c
on d.client_id = c.client_id
join bank.district da
on da.A1 = c.district_id;
```
