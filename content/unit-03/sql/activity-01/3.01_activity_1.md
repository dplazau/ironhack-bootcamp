Keep working on the `bank` database.

1. Get the number of clients by district, returning district name.
2. Are there districts with no clients? Move all clients from `Strakonice` to a new district with `district_id = 100`. Check again.
   **Hint**: In case you have some doubts, you can check [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp) how to use the update statement.
3. How would you spot clients with wrong or missing `district_id`?
4. Return clients to `Strakonice`.
